- [ ] Include a form with client-side validation. Login forms do not count as a form.
- [ ] Website must work the same in multiple browsers including Chrome and Firefox.
- [ ] The website must be as accessible as possible
- [ ] Include alternate text for images.
- [ ] Avoid colors common to color blindness.
- [ ] The home page for the project (and other pages if you think it fits in with your design) should contain an unobtrusive link to a page with information about your team with the text "Site created by [team name or members]".
- [ ] The team page should not be accessible other than by clicking the unobtrusive link (it is not part of the site - think of it as an extra "Easter egg").
- [ ] The team page should have a link back to the home page for the site.
- [ ] While the team page should fit in with the rest of the site (for instance, use a color scheme that matches the remainder of the site), it does not need to follow the exact same design as other pages on the site (for instance, no links to other pages).
- [ ] The team page should include the names of all team members (and pictures, if you want).
- [ ] The team page does not need to have two different layouts for desktop and mobile, but it should be responsive.
- [ ] The team page can include dynamic elements such as animation or video which could satisfy the requirements for #6, part 2. Have fun with it!
- [ ] The team page should contain appropriate content to show other people. (For instance, you may want to keep a copy of this project to show to prospective employers.)
- [ ] Your project should contain a docs folder including any files related to the project, such as:

#### Requirement and design documents
- [ ] A document indicating how the site could be updated and enhanced in the future; include what pages on the site you expect would need regular updating, and what content would need to be updated.
- [ ] A document describing what resources you used or researched, including books or websites that you used and any additional libraries, frameworks, or plug-ins that you used, and any sources for external images or videos.
- [ ] A document evaluating your website, including the elements for evaluating websites covered in Learning Outcome 6.
- [ ] A document indicating anything special that you did with the website, as indicated in #6, part 2.
